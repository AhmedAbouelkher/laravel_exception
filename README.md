# Motivation

- since we work with APIs built with `Laravel` almost daily
- i have built this package to easily wrap the validation exception which laravel might throw
- you can easily know which fields got rejected or have failed and there messages

# Content

- `LaravelException` Exception class which will parse the laravel response

# example

```dart
 // 422
if(res.statusCode == HttpStatus.unprocessableEntity){
      throw LaravelException.parse(res.data);
}

```

# Exception props ðŸ§¬

- `keys` contains the failed input keys in the exception object
- `errorMessages` contains the failed input keys in the exception object
- `firstErrorMessage` return the first failure message
- `toString()` convert the object to one big error message

# What is next ?

- [ ] dio interceptor
